/**
 * Model picker copy.
 *
 * The copy itself is NOT here. It ships as `model-descriptions.json` beside
 * the bundle, and the browser half fetches it at runtime (the host half
 * serves it under MODEL_COPY_ROUTE), so the model table grows without a
 * rebuild and no copy enters the bundle. The language comes from the shell's
 * own `locale` service — one line per row, in the language the rest of the
 * UI is in — never two languages stacked.
 *
 * The constants below are the neutral fallbacks painted before that document
 * arrives, and kept if it never does. They are English because a failed
 * fetch has no locale to honour.
