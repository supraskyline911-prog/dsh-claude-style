## Preview

The settings page's Brand mark row switches between the Claude and DeepSeek palettes, and light/dark follows your system's color mode. In each group the top row is the Studio home page and the bottom row a Markdown conversation, light on the left and dark on the right.

### Claude

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" width="50%"><img src="./docs/screenshots/claude-home-light.png" alt="Claude brand, Studio home — light" /></td>
    <td align="center" width="50%"><img src="./docs/screenshots/claude-home-dark.png" alt="Claude brand, Studio home — dark" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" width="50%"><img src="./docs/screenshots/claude-conversation-light.png" alt="Claude brand, Markdown conversation — light" /></td>
    <td align="center" width="50%"><img src="./docs/screenshots/claude-conversation-dark.png" alt="Claude brand, Markdown conversation — dark" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

> Light mode pairs an ivory canvas `#FCFCFB` with a pale sidebar `#FBFBF9`; dark mode uses warm black `#141413`. Ember orange `#D97757` is the single action accent across both canvases, and Claude Code's pixel crab stands on the composer on the home page and in conversations alike.

### DeepSeek

<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" width="50%"><img src="./docs/screenshots/deepseek-home-light.png" alt="DeepSeek brand, Studio home — light" /></td>
    <td align="center" width="50%"><img src="./docs/screenshots/deepseek-home-dark.png" alt="DeepSeek brand, Studio home — dark" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center" width="50%"><img src="./docs/screenshots/deepseek-conversation-light.png" alt="DeepSeek brand, Markdown conversation — light" /></td>
    <td align="center" width="50%"><img src="./docs/screenshots/deepseek-conversation-dark.png" alt="DeepSeek brand, Markdown conversation — dark" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

> Light mode is a white with a touch of sky blue, `#F7FAFF`, with the sidebar at `#F3F7FE`; dark mode is a blue-black `#13161D`. The accent is DeepSeek's brand blue `#4D6BFE`, and Deepy the pixel whale stands on the composer on the home page and in conversations alike.

## Features and settings

What the plugin does and what each setting changes is documented: [Features](docs/FEATURES.en.md), [Settings](docs/SETTINGS.en.md).

## Fonts

> **Important: the Anthropic fonts are not bundled with the npm package.** They are available for download in this repository under [`packages/assets/src/fonts/anthropic/`](packages/assets/src/fonts/anthropic/). You can either install them on your system, or skip the install entirely — drop the two `.ttf` files into `$DSH_HOME/dsh-claude-style/fonts/` (`~/.dsh/dsh-claude-style/fonts/` when `DSH_HOME` is unset) and the host will serve them as webfonts (the files are identical, so the result is the same). Either way, refresh or restart the web UI for the fonts to take effect.

| Font | Used for | File |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic Sans Web Text | Interface / UI | [`packages/assets/src/fonts/anthropic/AnthropicSansWebText.ttf`](https://github.com/supraskyline911-prog/dsh-claude-style/raw/master/packages/assets/src/fonts/anthropic/AnthropicSansWebText.ttf) |
| Anthropic Serif Web Text | Conversation body / Markdown | [`packages/assets/src/fonts/anthropic/AnthropicSerifWebText.ttf`](https://github.com/supraskyline911-prog/dsh-claude-style/raw/master/packages/assets/src/fonts/anthropic/AnthropicSerifWebText.ttf) |
| JetBrains Mono Variable | Code / code blocks | [`packages/assets/src/fonts/JetBrainsMonoVariable.ttf`](https://github.com/supraskyline911-prog/dsh-claude-style/raw/master/packages/assets/src/fonts/JetBrainsMonoVariable.ttf), [`packages/assets/src/fonts/JetBrainsMonoItalicVariable.ttf`](https://github.com/supraskyline911-prog/dsh-claude-style/raw/master/packages/assets/src/fonts/JetBrainsMonoItalicVariable.ttf) |
| Inter | Interface when Anthropic Sans is absent | [`packages/assets/src/fonts/InterVariable.woff2`](https://github.com/supraskyline911-prog/dsh-claude-style/raw/master/packages/assets/src/fonts/InterVariable.woff2) |
| Noto Serif | Conversation body when Anthropic Serif is absent | [`packages/assets/src/fonts/NotoSerifVariable.woff2`](https://github.com/supraskyline911-prog/dsh-claude-style/raw/master/packages/assets/src/fonts/NotoSerifVariable.woff2) |

JetBrains Mono, Inter and Noto Serif are licensed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 and ship with the npm package; nothing to set up. Inter and Noto Serif nearly match the two Anthropic fonts in letter height and width, so without the Anthropic fonts they stand in and the interface and conversation text keep their layout. Both carry only the Latin characters the Anthropic fonts cover; Chinese text keeps using the system's Chinese fonts.

To enable the Anthropic fonts, choose one of the following:

① Install them on your system — on Windows, double-click each `.ttf` and choose "Install"; on macOS, import them with Font Book.

② Skip the install — copy the `.ttf` files into `$DSH_HOME/dsh-claude-style/fonts/`, then refresh the page.

> The Anthropic Sans and Serif fonts are the property of Anthropic, licensed for personal use only, and are not covered by this project's MIT license.

## Skin center handoff

This theme is also offered as a **skin** in the DSH Skin Center. Selecting it there hands the whole page to this
plugin; selecting another skin or the official default takes the page back without a reload.

- The answer holds from the first frame: the Skin Center stamps `html[data-dsh-skin]` into the served document, so a
  page that boots with a skin already painting never flashes a frame of this theme first.
- While another skin paints the page this theme mounts no stylesheet, installs no feature and claims no document
  attribute at all. It takes the page back when the skin leaves and gives it back when a skin returns, a skin
  picked after the page loaded included.
- A wallpaper plugin is not another owner: while a wallpaper renders this theme keeps working, as described in
  [Settings](docs/SETTINGS.en.md) under "Alongside other theme plugins".
- The settings page and every stored preference survive the handoff. A skin taking the screen does not uninstall
  anything, and closing the Skin Center does not throw away what you configured here.
- `data-dsh-claude-style-handoff` on `body` marks a build that can do this; the Skin Center offers the row only
  while it is there.

## Installation

Install this repository's version from GitHub:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add supraskyline911-prog/dsh-claude-style
```

Keep only one theme enabled at a time. dsh ≥ 0.1.7 is required, and a restart of DeepSeek Harness brings the full feature set.

## Acknowledgements

The conversation navigator's opening list, keyboard jumps and landing line follow SherUnlocked-4869's [dsh-plugin-msg-nav](https://github.com/SherUnlocked-4869/dsh-plugin-msg-nav) (MIT).

The animation frames of Deepy the pixel whale come from the Deepy whale theme pack drawn by calmly-eating-bugs ([@wp3171216237](https://github.com/wp3171216237)), and ship with the plugin by the author's permission. Many thanks to the author! GIFs of all 20 animations, contributed by the author, are in [docs/gifs/](docs/gifs/).

The pixel crab (Clawd) is a character of Anthropic, and all rights in it remain with Anthropic. Its laptop animation is taken from Claude Code; the animations of its other states are drawn by this project after that character. The crab's frames are not covered by the MIT license (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). This plugin is an unofficial fan work, not affiliated with or endorsed by Anthropic.
